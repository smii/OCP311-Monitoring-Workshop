 Monitoring on OpenShift
-----------------------

In this workshop we will first deploy we will deploy Prometheus and Grafana on OpenShift to monitor your cluster. As bonus assignment you can deploy a sample NodeJS application on Minishift on which we can retreive Metrics in Prometheus and make them yourself visible in Grafana by creating Graphs.


Prerequisites:
* Minishift can be found [here](https://github.com/minishift/minishift/releases)
* OC command-line can be found  [here](https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases)

Start Minishift with the following options: 
* Minishift Addon 'admin' enabled
* Start Minishift with at least 5GB of ram

Example: 
```bash
minishift addons enable admin-user
minishift start --vm-driver=virtual-box  --memory=5gb 
```

###  Log-in to your enviromnent:
When Minishift is started it will return an url and automaticly will login to your envirmnent  with the user 'developer' when the OC commandline tool is properly installed.
For this workshop we will need to login with the user 'admin' or a user that has the 'cluster-admin' role.

### Login as user 'admin' with password 'admin' using the oc command-line tool
```bash
oc login <demo environment url>
The server uses a certificate signed by an unknown authority.
You can bypass the certificate check, but any data you send to the server could be intercepted by others.
Use insecure connections? (y/n): y

Authentication required for <demo environment url> (openshift)
Username: admin    
Password: 
Login successful.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

  * default
    grafana
    kube-dns
    kube-proxy
<snip>

Using project "default".
```

### Commands to verify you are in the right environment
```bash
oc whoami
oc project
```

```
### Deploy prometheus and node-exporter
```bash
oc new-app -f prometheus/prometheus.yaml -n kube-system
oc get pods -n kube-system
oc describe pod prometheus-0 -n kube-system
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-reader system:serviceaccount:default:prometheus -n kube-system
oc create -f prometheus/node-exporter.yaml -n kube-system
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user -z prometheus-node-exporter hostaccess -n kube-system
oc get routes -n kube-system
 ```
#### Find the route to prometheus and save it we will need this later to configure Grafana.

```bash
oc get routes -n kube-system
```

### Deploy grafana 
```bash
oc new-project grafana
oc new-app -f "grafana/grafana.yaml" -n grafana
oc rollout status deployment/grafana -n grafana
oc adm policy add-role-to-user view -z grafana -n kube-system
oc get routes -n grafana
oc sa get-token prometheus -n kube-system
```
### Adding datasource to Grafana
Run the following commands and save the output. You will need these to create the datasource in Grafana

```bash

oc sa get-token prometheus -n kube-system
oc get routes -n kube-system
```

Fill in the token & Prometheus in the designates fields as shown in the picture below, also don't forget to tick the boxes as (With credentials, Skip TLS verification)

### Openshift single-node Dashboard
You can find the single node cluster dashboard in the dashboards folder that comes with the GIT repository which will work out of the box when everything is configured correctly.

# Bonus assigment: 
### Pull and create metrics from a sample application. 
### To do this assigment you will need to have Prometheus and Grafana in order. And your Virual Machines will need at least 6GB of RAM.

### Deploy sample application from which you can receive metrics
```bash
# Create project for our appl
oc new-project demoproject
# Deploy the app
oc new-app https://github.com/smii/workshop.git --context-dir=example-prometheus-nodejs -n demoproject
# Expose the port which exposes metrics
oc expose dc/workshop --name=workshop-svc --port=3001 -n demoproject
# Expose app to the outside world (optional)
oc expose svc/workshop-svc -n demoproject
# Get the route to the sample applcation
oc get routes -n demoproject
```
You can access the list of available metrics by accessing the route + /metrics contextpath

Sample url: 
```
https://workshop-svc-demoproject.192.168.99.101.nip.io/metrics
```
### Scraper example
Edit the prometheus configmap in order to configure new scrape target.
```bash
oc edit configmap prometheus -n kube-system
```
Paste the following sample (NodeJS application) scrape configuration into the configmap and save:
```bash
    - job_name: NodeJS
      scrape_interval: 5s
      scrape_timeout: 5s
      static_configs:
      - targets:
        - workshop-svc.demoproject.svc:3001
        labels:
          app: nodejs
          sandbox: nodejs
```
Reload prometheus to re-read the scrap configuration.
```bash
  $ oc project kube-system
  $ oc rsh -c prometheus prometheus-0
  $ curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/-/reload
```
Review if the NodeJS metrics are scraped by Prometheus by looking at he the target page of Prometheus in your browser


### Query example Grafana

Scrape CPU activitiy from a specific pod on a specific namespace
```
container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{namespace=<namespace>, pod_name=<pod name>"}
```

Visualize the same example in Grafana
```
sum (irate (container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{namespace="<namespace>", pod_name="<pod name>"}[2m]))
```
